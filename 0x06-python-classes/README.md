### Tasks on 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects project
- Requirements:
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	- All your files should end with a new line
	- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
	- All your files must be executable
	- The length of your files will be tested using wc
	- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
	- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
	- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
	- A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
