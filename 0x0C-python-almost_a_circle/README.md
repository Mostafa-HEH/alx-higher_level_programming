## Tasks on project 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle:
- Requirements:
	- Python Scripts:
		- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
		- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
		- All your files should end with a new line
		- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
		- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
		- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
		- All your files must be executable
		- The length of your files will be tested using wc
		- All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
		- All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
		- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
		- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
	- Python Unit Tests:
		- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
		- All your files should end with a new line
		- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
		- You have to use the unittest module
		- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
		- All your test files and folders should start with test_
		- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
		- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
		- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
		- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case

- Task 0: All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
- Task 1: Write the first class Base, Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package, Create a file named models/base.py
- Task 2: Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base.
- Task 3: Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded).
- Task 4: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you don’t need to handle x and y here.
- Task 5: Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
- Task 6: Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
